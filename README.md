# liquibase-springboot-h2-example

This is a sample project to demonstrate integration of Liquibase and H2 embedded database with Spring Boot application.

Liquibase is an open-source database schema change management solution which enables you to manage revisions of your database changes easily. Liquibase makes it easy for anyone involved in the application release process to:

Eliminate errors and delays when releasing databases.
Deploy and roll back changes for specific versions without needing to know what has already been deployed.
Deploy database and application changes together so they always stay in sync.
